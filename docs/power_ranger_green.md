The Power Ranger Green, also known as Orion “The Wildheart,” is the untamed spirit of the team, bringing boundless energy and an unbreakable connection to nature. His love for plants goes beyond mere appreciation—he treats them like family, even giving them names and engaging in long (one-sided) conversations. His personal collection of potted plants rivals a small rainforest, and he takes every opportunity to sneak new greenery into the team’s headquarters. Orion insists that plants have personalities and claims he can sense their emotions, much to the amusement (and occasional concern) of his teammates.

The Power Ranger Green’s special ability is naturally tied to plant life—but with a rather niche application. He can accelerate plant growth, but only for small flora like herbs, vines, and flowers. While this makes him the ultimate gardener, it hasn’t exactly struck fear into the hearts of villains. That said, Orion has found clever ways to weaponize his power, often using fast-growing vines to trip up enemies or create natural barricades. Despite his limitations, he dreams of one day summoning a mighty oak to crush his foes—though, for now, he settles for wielding an especially sturdy bamboo staff.

The Power Ranger Green has a deep, well-hidden fear that he prays no one will ever discover: he is absolutely terrified of bugs. While he loves nature, any encounter with an insect sends him into a panicked frenzy. His teammates find it hilarious that the “protector of the forest” can’t handle a simple beetle, often using fake plastic bugs to prank him. Orion insists he’s working on overcoming his fear, but every time a spider appears, he’s the first to teleport out of the room.

Beyond his connection to nature, the Power Ranger Green is a skilled survivalist. Whether it’s building a shelter from scratch, foraging for food, or starting a fire without a match, Orion’s skills make him an invaluable asset in the wild. His idea of relaxation isn’t sitting indoors but venturing deep into the wilderness, where he can “reconnect with the roots of existence.” He often invites his teammates on camping trips, though they’ve learned to bring extra snacks—his “foraged meals” tend to be an acquired taste.

The Power Ranger Green is also a passionate environmental activist. When he’s not fighting villains, he’s organizing tree-planting initiatives, cleaning up polluted areas, or passionately lecturing his teammates about sustainability. His enthusiasm can be overwhelming at times, but his sincerity is undeniable. His dream is to create a massive “Ranger Forest” where generations of heroes can train in harmony with nature.

His personal style is as wild as his spirit. Orion is rarely seen without his moss-green hooded cloak, which he insists helps him “blend into the natural world.” His wardrobe consists mostly of earth tones, vine-wrapped accessories, and leather boots built for trekking through rough terrain. His fashion sense might not be as flashy as Pierre’s or as refined as Marina’s, but his rugged look has earned him a devoted following among outdoor enthusiasts.

On the battlefield, the Power Ranger Green moves like the wind—swift, unpredictable, and impossible to pin down. His fighting style relies on agility, using acrobatics and nature itself to outmaneuver opponents. His signature battle cry, “The forest never falls!” is a rallying call for resilience, though his teammates sometimes joke that he should update it after tripping over his own vines one too many times.

As a cook, Orion is both adventurous and questionable. His “Jungle Stew” is infamous among the team—not because it tastes bad, but because no one ever truly knows what’s in it. He claims every batch is “a unique gift from nature,” but after one particularly suspicious meal, the team made a pact to never eat his cooking unsupervised again.

Despite his quirks, the Power Ranger Green’s heart is as vast as the forests he protects. His relentless optimism, deep respect for life, and unwavering belief in teamwork make him a vital part of the team. Though his battles may be waged with vines and roots rather than brute strength, Orion proves that true power comes from growth, resilience, and an unbreakable bond with the world around him.
