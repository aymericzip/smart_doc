The Power Ranger Yellow, also known as Solène “The Radiant,” is the team’s unstoppable source of energy, embodying the warmth and brightness of the sun itself. Her enthusiasm is infectious, and no matter the situation, she finds a way to lift everyone’s spirits. A self-proclaimed connoisseur of all things citrus, Solène has an uncanny ability to identify any fruit’s origin with just a single taste. Her personal quest to find the "ultimate lemon" has taken her across farmers' markets, orchards, and even international citrus festivals. Her collection of rare and exotic citrus fruits is stored in a special fridge, which she guards like a treasure chest.

The Power Ranger Yellow’s special ability revolves around light—but with a rather unexpected limitation. While she can summon dazzling bursts of radiant energy, they’re only bright enough to function as makeshift flashlights or create small, glowing orbs. While this makes her invaluable during blackouts and underground missions, it hasn’t exactly helped her in large-scale battles. However, she’s learned to weaponize her power in creative ways—blinding enemies momentarily or using her glowing orbs to create distractions. Though she longs for the ability to unleash a solar-powered blast, she makes up for it with sheer determination.

The Power Ranger Yellow hides one secret she hopes her teammates never uncover: she is absolutely terrified of the dark. Despite wielding light-based powers, the thought of being trapped in pitch-black darkness fills her with panic. During overnight missions, she secretly keeps a tiny glow-in-the-dark keychain in her pocket for comfort. Her teammates suspect something, especially since she volunteers to keep the lights on at HQ “for safety reasons,” but they’ve never confronted her about it.

Outside of battle, Solène is the ultimate hype-woman for the team. Whether it’s organizing spontaneous dance parties, blasting motivational speeches before missions, or handing out personalized “positivity notes,” she ensures that no one ever feels discouraged. Her boundless optimism can be overwhelming at times, but deep down, her teammates know they’d be lost without her. She believes that energy and morale are just as important as strength, and she takes her role as the team's motivator seriously.

The Power Ranger Yellow is also a fitness fanatic, constantly inventing new and bizarre workout routines. She insists that “combat cardio” is the key to success and has dragged her teammates through sunrise yoga, high-speed parkour drills, and something she calls “Thunder Squats.” While most of the team struggles to keep up, they can’t deny that her training keeps them in peak condition. However, her legendary “Citrus Smoothie Blends” remain a subject of controversy—some swear by them, while others claim they taste like liquid sunshine mixed with regret.

Her wardrobe reflects her vibrant personality, favoring bold yellows, golden hues, and energetic patterns. She’s never seen without her signature sun-shaped earrings, which she insists bring her good luck. Her everyday attire often includes sporty, high-energy outfits, perfect for impromptu dance-offs or last-minute missions. At conventions, her distinctive style has made her a fan favorite, with admirers dubbing her the “Golden Dynamo.”

On the battlefield, the Power Ranger Yellow fights with relentless speed and precision, using agility and rapid strikes to overwhelm her foes. Her signature battle cry, “Let the sun shine on victory!” is often met with either admiration or playful groans from her teammates, who claim she has an entire notebook filled with light-based catchphrases. Despite their teasing, they all agree that her unwavering spirit is what keeps them pushing forward in even the toughest battles.

As a cook, Solène specializes in citrus-infused dishes, though her obsession has led to some… unusual culinary experiments. Her “Zesty Inferno Pancakes” are notorious for their extreme levels of tanginess, and her homemade “Lemon Surprise Cake” once left the entire team puckering for hours. While her flavors might be intense, her passion for sharing food as a way of spreading joy is undeniable.

Though her light may not be the most powerful, the Power Ranger Yellow proves that true brightness comes from within. Her ability to inspire, uplift, and keep the team moving forward makes her an irreplaceable force. Whether it’s in battle, during training, or simply in everyday life, Solène’s radiance reminds everyone that being a hero isn’t just about fighting—it’s about shining, even when times are dark.
